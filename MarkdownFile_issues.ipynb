This was necessary because HLS4ML, a tool used in the project, had not been updated to support TensorFlow 2.16.0 at the backend. Therefore, to ensure compatibility and proper functioning of HLS4ML, the decision was made to revert to TensorFlow 2.14.0."

        "- **Description:** The decision was made to switch from using the ResNet50 model to IMDB Sentiment Analysis. This change was prompted by concerns regarding the size and complexity of the previous model. The ResNet50 model was quite large, approximately 103 MB, and after converting it to C code using Keras2C, it resulted in around 5.2 million lines of code. This large codebase may have been cumbersome to manage and deploy efficiently.\n",
        "- **Resolution:** To address these concerns, the IMDB Sentiment Analysis model was chosen as an alternative. This model is likely to be smaller and less complex compared to ResNet50, which can lead to easier management and deployment. Additionally, it may offer better performance for the specific task of sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset."
